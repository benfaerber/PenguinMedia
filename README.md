# PenguinMedia
Web Media Server, written in PHP. View all your favorite files on the web!

Download the files and host them on a local server. Head to your local IP address to view the files.
The site is compatible with most devices, including the web browsers of Phones, Computers, Game Consoles, etc.

To add content, add it to the media folder.
Note: Video files must be Web Optimized, I use HandBrake to optimize my files.
